# Old Dotfiles
This consists of dotfiles that I used to use that are no longer needed. This repository currently includes:
- My DWM, ST, and Tabbed forks.
- Fonts to go along, including Cascadia Code.
- Xresources (since none of the applications I use need it).
- Scripts for Suckless, including a quick Maim + XClip shortcut, as well as a shortcut for Tabbed.

There isn't any Nix integration with these since I wasn't using it beforehand, but they should be relatively easy to get running on any system.
